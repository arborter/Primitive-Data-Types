Primitive Data Types have many definitions, but one I find most persuasive is the primitive defined as the smallest unit of measurement in a system. That is to say that whatever program we are running, if we strip down every piece of code to its basics, we have primitives which, in some sense, represent atoms as known by Democritus.
